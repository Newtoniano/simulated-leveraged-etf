This is a fork of the amazing work done by [DoctorJ](https://gitlab.com/doctorj) in [this repo](https://gitlab.com/doctorj/quantitative-investing), with a few bug fixes and dependency updates. The goal is to maintain the code so it's fully functional, and potentially adding a few more ETFs along the road, especially simulated unleveraged ones.

# Quantitative Investing

Notebooks for simulating leveraged ETFs, robust Monte Carlo backtesting, and dynamic allocation.

### Leveraged ETFs [[View](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/urls/gitlab.com/doctorj/quantitative-investing/-/raw/master/Leveraged%20ETFs.ipynb), [Run](https://mybinder.org/v2/gl/doctorj%2Fquantitative-investing/master?filepath=Leveraged%20ETFs.ipynb)]: Extend leveraged ETFs back in time

You can also just [download the data as CSV](extended-leveraged-etfs.csv) for a few extended ETFs.
